AI-Powered, Eco-Inspired.

### Existing Problems Within Construction

1. Surveying Challenge Terrain with Complex Landforms
2. Crafting a Detail Conceptual Site Model
3. Long Wait Times To Obtain A Building Permit

  *TreeGuard's cutting-edge tech uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to streamline land surveys, offering detailed mappings and 3D models, which expedites the permitting, planning, and building processes.*

### Market Opportunities

1. Commercial Construction Industry
2. Residential Construction Industry
3. Environmental Monitoring
4. Carbon Credit Trade Market
5. Commercial Farming

*Outside of the commercial and residential construction industries, there are also major potential impacts in areas such as environmental monitoring and regulation, the carbon credit trade market, and commercial farming.*
